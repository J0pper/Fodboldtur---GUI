  - [x] Filter log
    - [x] Save messages
    - [x] Action messages
    - [x] Data loaded successfully messages
  - [ ] Autosave

### Complete feature-list
1. Make transactions for registered members. Both in and out of the accounts.
2. Add new members with a starting amount. Adding new members updates each person debt; the total debt divided with the new amount of members.
3. Remove members. Removing members also updates each person debt.
4. Show the leaderboard of shame with the 3 people who've paid the least.
5. Settings window with settings for saving and logging. 
6. Complete Logging systems with a filter for log-types in the settings.
7. Autosave with a toggle-switch in the settings.
8. Progress bar and text displaying the progress towards the pay-goal.
